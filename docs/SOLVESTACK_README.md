# Peerlogic API - Solvestack instructions

## Docker

### Initial setup

Create a new file in the root of the peerlogic-api directory called `.env`.

Paste the contents of this 1Password secret into the `.env` file

See 1Password for a starter file entitled "Solvestack peerlogic-api LOCAL starter .env file". This link expires each time we give it out within 30 days. We only give it out to mentees in the Solvestack slack to make sure Peerlogic's platform is always safe and secure.

Make sure you [join our Solvestack Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/solvestack/shared_invite/zt-9l9a253a-uCsIlUe8Gz4fllRGmEa~pw) and go to #solve-your-career-ongoing-meetups to get this link.
